      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# Multimodal Robot Learning with Vision-Language Models

A comprehensive system integrating vision-language models, segmentation, and reinforcement learning for advanced robotic manipulation. The system uses natural language commands to control robots while understanding visual scenes and adapting to new environments.

## Features
- Integration of GPT-4V for scene understanding
- Segment Anything Model (SAM) for real-time object segmentation
- Custom RL policy conditioned on language embeddings
- Real-time visual feedback loop
- Sim2real transfer with domain adaptation
- Custom CUDA kernels for real-time inference
